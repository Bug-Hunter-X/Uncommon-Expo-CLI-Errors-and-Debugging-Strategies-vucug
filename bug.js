This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  The exact error message might vary, but it often involves issues with the package.json file or incorrect configuration settings within the project.

**Example Scenario:** Imagine you're trying to run `expo start` and encounter an error like this:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'expo-constants'
```

This suggests that the Expo Constants package, essential for many Expo apps, isn't correctly installed or linked within your project.

**Another Scenario:** You might encounter issues related to missing or mismatched dependencies or versions. For example:

```
Error:  The package @react-navigation/native requires a peer of react-native@^0.60.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
```

This indicates a dependency conflict or missing peer dependency, a common problem in managing Expo and React Native projects.

**Note:**  The specific error will vary greatly depending on the project configuration and the actions you are performing in the Expo CLI.
