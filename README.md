# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI and provides solutions to resolve them.  These errors are less frequently reported and can be challenging to troubleshoot.

**Common Causes:**

* Dependency Conflicts: Mismatched or missing peer dependencies are a significant source of unusual Expo CLI errors.
* Incorrect Configuration: Errors in `package.json`, `app.json`, or other project configuration files.
* Expo Go Issues: Problems with the Expo Go app itself, such as cached data or corrupted installations.
* Environment Specific Issues: These are highly context dependent.
